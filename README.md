# popcorntime-release
Just the built release of Popcorn time - much fresher than an official release in https://github.com/popcorn-official/popcorn-desktop/

I don't relate to Popcorntime, I'm not even a contributer. I just wanted to find a fresh release of this amazing app. 

[This is the issue that started it all](https://github.com/popcorn-official/popcorn-desktop/issues/959). [This is the way how to get even fresher release from https://ci.popcorntime.sh by yourself](https://github.com/popcorn-official/popcorn-desktop/issues/963).
